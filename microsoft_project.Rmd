# number of unique complaints
cat("Number of complaints = ", length(unique(nyc_data$ComplaintID)), "\n")

# Note: Some complaints include several allegations for the same officer
# or for a number of officers


# Goal: Bucket each officer in one of the 10 buckets by the number of complaints.
# TODO: Figure out a way to count the number of complaints for each officer.
# Note: The names are not unique or sufficient to be used to identify each officer.
# Update: It seems like the OfficerID columns represents each officer uniquely.
